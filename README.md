To set this up, copy the script to (for example) /usr/libexec/i3blocks
Next, chmod 755 /usr/lib/exec/i3blocks/moon_phase

Now add something like the following to your i3blocks config file

[moon]

Finally, restart i3 with $mod+Shift+r

The calculations for this script were taken from Practical Astronomy With Your Calculator or Spreadsheet
